# Golang Primer

This repo holds all the practice questions to get started in Golang.

## Day 1 Overview
Below are the topics covered on Day 1, showcasing the essential concepts in Golang that were explored.

1. Variable Declaration and Scope

- Declared and printed variables with different scopes (package and function).
- Used shorthand for declaring and updating variables.
- Swapped values between variables.

2. Constants

- Declared and printed constants with fixed values.

3. Data Types and Conversion

- Worked with basic types like `int`, `float32`, `float64`, and `uint16`.
- Converted between data types (e.g., float to int, hexadecimal to decimal).

4. Basic Arithmetic and Input/Output

- Performed arithmetic operations and calculated averages.
- Handled user input with `fmt.Scanln` and formatted output with `fmt.Printf`.

5. Logical Operators

- Applied logical operators in conditional expressions.

6. Control Flow and Conditionals

- Used switch statements for branching based on conditions.

7. Loops and Pattern Printing

- Utilized loops to print patterns and understand iterative logic.

8. Arrays and Slices

- Initialized, accessed, updated, and printed arrays.
- Managed arrays based on user input.
